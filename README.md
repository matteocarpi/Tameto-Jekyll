***Tameto-Jekyll***

**A simple, basic starter for Jekyll sites**

This theme is a base-ground to build static webpages with Jekyll. It only includes the files that I always use when bulding a website.


The prime and only purpuse is avoiding loosing time creating from zero all the folders, the includes and the stylesheet, but also it doesn't oblidge you to install a prestyled theme with a lot of stuff you may not need.


It's taken down to the bone (is that the way you say that?). Well, it's just got what you definitely need and nothing more, so you can build on top of it, instead of painfully removing what you don't need.


**Usage**

Clone the repo, fill in what you need in the _config.yml_, and go!
